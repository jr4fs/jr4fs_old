abstract = {We present a novel semi-supervised framework for training classifiers and simultaneously
detecting out-of-distribution inputs. We do this by training on an closed classification
dataset and an auxiliary simulated-open dataset, which consists of examples from outside
the closed set. Through unsupervised learning and incorporating a class-distance value
for each known class, we can identify out-of-distribution RF devices with state-of-the-art
accuracy. We define metrics for quantifying robustness in terms of both classification
and Open Set Recognition (OSR). Finally we discuss uncertainty estimation and calibrate
our open set predictions so that they represent confidence.},
